#Questions session 14-2
1. How can we deal with larger datasets? Rstudio doesn't let us merge all three datasets since that's too large
2. How can we write a function that does the group_by and summarize function automatically? (i.e. function(group_by_variable, mean_variable))
3. Our data has repeated observation for each listing. How should we deal with this when doing the analyses?
