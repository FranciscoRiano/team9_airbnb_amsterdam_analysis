## Introduction

Do factors like distance to/from Amsterdam Central station, distance to/from Schiphol airport, distance to/from tram stops and distance to/from metro stops influence the prices of AirBnB listings? And does the effect of the several infrastructure components on AirBnB pricing differ depending on whether there is a holiday or not?

### Motivation

Infrastructure is the key to developing a successful tourism destination. Tourism industry stimulates investments in new infrastructure, most of which improves the living conditions of local residents as well as tourists. While Airbnb plays an important role in the tourism industry of today, infrastructure components might influence prices of Airbnb listings accordingly. Therefore questions like: 'Does the distance to/from Amsterdam Central Station or the distance to/from Schiphol Airport in relation to the location of the Airbnb listing influence the prices of that Airbnb listing?' could be asked. This code is written in order to find answers to these questions which focuses on Airbnb listings in Amsterdam.

## Background

## Data

The data used in this project come from website insideairbnb.com and ??? (holidays). Inside AirBnB is an open source activist project that provides publicly available data from AirBnB. 

### Data Collection

This research focuses on price analysis of AirBnB in Amsterdam, the Netherlands between years 2012 and 2019. Therefore, only data from Amsterdam in 2012-2019 were downloaded form the website, namely, listings and calendar information. The downloaded files were stored in Google Drive to ensure the same dataset can be also accessed in the future. To download the data see data/download_data.R.

### Data Processing

Several steps were taken in order to create a final dataset that will be used throughout the analysis. Firstly, all the non-essential variables were removed from listings dataset. Id and five control variables were kept namely, property_type, room_type, accommodates, bedrooms, beds. Next, the listings dataset was merged with distance variable which shows the number of meters from a given accommodation to the Amsterdam Central station. Lastly, datasets calendar, listings and holidays were merged together. Missing values ???...

## Methodology

The research method that is used in this project is a regression analysis. This method is used to predict the influence of the independent variables 'Distance to/from Amsterdam Central Station', 'Distance to/from Schiphol Airport', 'Distance to/from tram stops', 'Distance to/from metro stops' on the dependent variable 'Prices of Airbnb listings'. Furthermore the moderator 'Holidays in NL' will be included and analyzed. According to this model, the research questions can be answered.


## Results

## Conclusion

### Managerial Relevance

### Limitations and Future Directions of Research

This study has also some limitations. Firstly, the research was geographically limited to Amsterdam and it only analyzed data from AirBnB. Thus, future study can focus on different location or industry to improve the generalizability. Secondly, other factors that might be driving or influencing the relationship could be evaluated. For example, the reviews and ratings as well as sentiment between reviews might be another drivers of the relationship and can provide interesting insights in general.
