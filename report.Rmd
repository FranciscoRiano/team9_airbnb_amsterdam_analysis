## Introduction

### Motivation

## Background

## Data

The data used in this project come from website insideairbnb.com and ??? (holidays). Inside AirBnB is an open source activist project that provides publicly available data from AirBnB. 

### Data Collection

This research focuses on price analysis of AirBnB in Amsterdam, the Netherlands between years 2012 and 2019. Therefore, only data from Amsterdam in 2012-2019 were downloaded form the website, namely, listings and calendar information. The downloaded files were stored in Google Drive to ensure the same dataset can be also accessed in the future. To download the data see data/download_data.R.

### Data Processing

Several steps were taken in order to create a final dataset that will be used throughout the analysis. Firstly, all the non-essential variables were removed from listings dataset. Id and five control variables were kept namely, property_type, room_type, accommodates, bedrooms, beds. Next, the listings dataset was merged with distance variable which shows the number of meters from a given accommodation to the Amsterdam Central station. Lastly, datasets calendar, listings and holidays were merged together. Missing values ???...

### Managerial Relevance

### Limitations and Future Directions of Research

This study has also some limitations. Firstly, the research was geographically limited to Amsterdam and it only analyzed data from AirBnB. Thus, future study can focus on different location or industry to improve the generalizability. Secondly, other factors that might be driving or influencing the relationship could be evaluated. For example, the reviews and ratings as well as sentiment between reviews might be another drivers of the relationship and can provide interesting insights in general.
