## Introduction

Do factors like distance to/from Amsterdam Central station, distance to/from Schiphol airport, distance to/from tram stops and distance to/from metro stops influence the prices of AirBnB listings? And does the effect of the several infrastructure components on AirBnB pricing differ depending on whether there is a holiday or not?

### Motivation

Infrastructure is the key to developing a successful tourism destination. Tourism industry stimulates investments in new infrastructure, most of which improves the living conditions of local residents as well as tourists. While Airbnb plays an important role in the tourism industry of today, infrastructure components might influence prices of Airbnb listings accordingly. Therefore questions like: 'Does the distance to/from Amsterdam Central Station or the distance to/from Schiphol Airport in relation to the location of the Airbnb listing influence the prices of that Airbnb listing?' could be asked. This code is written in order to find answers to these questions which focuses on Airbnb listings in Amsterdam.

## Background

## Data

The data used in this project come from website insideairbnb.com which is an open source activist project that provides publicly available data from AirBnB. Moreover,infrastructure information was collected from city of Amsterdam website at maps.amsterdam.nl. Lastly, a new dataset was created with Dutch holidays.

### Data Collection

This research focuses on price analysis of AirBnB in Amsterdam, the Netherlands between years 2012 and 2019. Therefore, only data from Amsterdam in 2012-2019 were downloaded form the website, namely, listings and calendar information. The downloaded files were stored in Google Drive to ensure the same dataset can be also accessed in the future. To download the data see data/download_data.R.

### Data Processing

Several steps were taken in order to create a final dataset that will be used throughout the analysis. Firstly, in the holidays dataset new variable "weekend" was created. Next, datasets listings, distance, calendar and holidays were joined together creating a new merged dataset. Furthermore, two new constructs per each infrastructure point of interest were created. The first variable calculates the distance from each accommodation to metro, tram, swimming pool, Schiphol airport, Central station, place of religion, park, sport facilities. The second variable states how many of the eight above mentioned infrastructure measures can be find within 500 meters. Last step was to clean the data during which missing values were reviewed and price variables were converted from character to numeric type. The final cleaned dataset that will be used for the analysis was saved to folder gen/output.

## Methodology

The research method that is used in this project is a regression analysis. This method is used to predict the influence of the independent variables 'Distance to/from Amsterdam Central Station', 'Distance to/from Schiphol Airport', 'Distance to/from tram stops', 'Distance to/from metro stops' on the dependent variable 'Prices of Airbnb listings'. Furthermore the moderator 'Holidays in NL' will be included and analyzed. According to this model, the research questions can be answered.

## Results

## Conclusion

### Managerial Relevance
Prices of AirBnb accommodation vary across cities and countries. There are various factors that can play a role in the price setting but this study focuses on the infrastructure as it is a crucial aspect when deciding where to travel. If the the analysis shows that living close to certain kind of infrastructure leads to higher price, these insights can be further used by the management of Airbnb as well as the host for more effective price setting. Public policy makers can also benefit from this research. If there is a significant effect of infrastructure on pricing, they should invest in developing and improving it.

### Limitations and Future Directions of Research

This study has also some limitations. The research was geographically limited to Amsterdam so future studies could focus on different location to test the generalizability of the results. Moreover, only data collected from AirBnB were analyzed in this study. Thus, focusing on other hospitality providers or another industry might bring interesting results. Furthermore, other factors that likely have effect on price could be included in the future studies. For example, reviews and ratings as well as review sentiment might be driving or influencing the relationship to some extent. Hence, building upon the current study by adding impact of reviews could provide new insights.
